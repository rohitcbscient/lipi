/*
 * The SGI coordinate system: the center is at the sun center; X axis
 * points at the earth; Z is normal to the ecliptic plane; Y makes right-
 * handed system (XYZ). (Roughly speaking, X points to us, Y - to the left,
 * and Z upwards).

/* 
 * For a given observer SGI position (obs) and nRay direction vectors,
 * dir[nRay][3], of the straight rays, calculates the positions,
 * pos[nRay][3] of the ray intersections with the sphere of the radius rsph
 * drawn around the SGI center (0,0,0).
 * Of the two line-sphere intersection points, the one closer to the
 * observer position (obs) is stored in pos[][3]. 
 * If rsph = 1., it is the solar surface.
 *
 * Upon return, i-th element of the array isec[nRay] contains the number of 
 * intersections of the i-th ray with the integration sphere.
 * Also, a zero triplet in obs[i][:] indicates that the i-th ray 
 * does not penetrate the sphere. The tangential point coordinats are saved 
 * in pos[][:], but for the same ray index isec[] contains 1.
 * Raytracing makes sense for only those rays whose isec == 2.  
 * The function returns the total number of intersection points as the
 * sum of those over all the rays. 
 * If the ray does not intersect the sphere, 0 is added to the total. 
 * In case of a tangential ray, 1 is added. For two intersection points, 
 * 2 is added. Only if the returned number is 2*nRay, all the rays 
 * penetrate the integration sphere.
 *
 * The problem is reduced to solving the quadratic equation:
 *
 *  dir^2*dist^2 + 2(dir.obs)*dist + (obs^2 - rsph^2) = 0
 *
