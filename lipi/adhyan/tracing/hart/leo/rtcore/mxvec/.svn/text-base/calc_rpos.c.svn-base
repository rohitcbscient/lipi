 * The SGI coordinate system: the center is at the sun center; X axis
 * points at the earth; Z is normal to the ecliptic plane; Y makes right-
 * handed system (XYZ). (Roughly speaking, X points to us, Y - to the left,
 * and Z upwards).

/* 
 * For a given observer SGI position (obs) and the direction (dir) of the
 * straight ray, calculates the position (pos) of the ray intersection with
 * the sphere of the radius (rsph) drawn around the SGI center (0,0,0).
 * Of the two line-sphere intersection points, the one closer to the
 * observer position (obs) is returned. 
 * If rsph = 1., it is the solar surface.
 *
 * The function returns the number of intersection points. 
 * If the ray does not intersect the sphere, 0 is returned. In case of 
 * tangential ray, 1 is returned. For two intersection points, 2 is returned.
 *
 * The problem is reduced to solving the quadratic equation:
 *
 *  dir^2*dist^2 + 2(dir.obs)*dist + (obs^2 - rsph^2) = 0
